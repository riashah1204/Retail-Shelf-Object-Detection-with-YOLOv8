# Retail Shelf Object Detector Using YOLOv8
Ever wondered what's on a retail shelf just by looking at a photo? Detect and count retail products from both photos and real-time camera feedsâ€”instantly! This smart and simple app uses YOLOv8 to analyze retail shelves, highlight every product it spots, and give you a clear count. 

The Retail Shelf Object Detector is a web app built with YOLOv8 and Gradio. It lets you upload retail shelf images or use your webcam to detect and count products in real time.
